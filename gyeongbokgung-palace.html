            <h2>The Palace Greatly Blessed by Heaven</h2>
            <p>
                Step into the heart of the Joseon Dynasty at Gyeongbokgung Palace, the grandest of Seoul's Five Grand Palaces. Completed in 1395, its name means "palace greatly blessed by Heaven." As the main royal palace for centuries, it stands as a stunning testament to classic Korean architecture and was the center of life for kings, queens, and the royal court.
            </p>

            <h2>A Story of Resilience</h2>
            <p>
                The palace has witnessed both golden ages and great turmoil. It was the center of power during the reign of King Sejong the Great, who developed the Korean alphabet, Hangeul, within its walls. However, the palace was tragically destroyed by fire during Japanese invasions and lay in ruins for over 270 years. Rebuilt in the 19th century, it suffered again during the Japanese occupation. Today, a meticulous, ongoing restoration project is bringing Gyeongbokgung back to its former glory, showcasing the resilience of Korean heritage.
