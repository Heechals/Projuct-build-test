            <h2>The Palace Greatly Blessed by Heaven</h2>
            <p>
                Gyeongbokgung Palace, located in the heart of Seoul, is the largest and most iconic of the Five Grand Palaces built during the Joseon Dynasty. Completed in 1395, its name means "palace greatly blessed by Heaven." It served as the main royal palace for centuries and stands as a stunning testament to classic Korean architectural principles.

            <h2>A Journey Through History</h2>
            <p>
                The palace has witnessed both golden ages and great turmoil. It was the center of power during the reign of King Sejong the Great, who developed the Korean alphabet, Hangeul, within its walls. However, the palace was tragically destroyed by fire during the Japanese invasions of the late 16th century and lay in ruins for over 270 years.
            </p>
            <p>
                A massive reconstruction effort took place in the 19th century under King Gojong, but much of it was again systematically demolished during the Japanese occupation in the early 20th century. Since the 1990s, a dedicated restoration project has been underway to bring Gyeongbokgung back to its former glory.
