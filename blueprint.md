# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a web application that introduces users to Korean culture. It includes sections for K-Food, Virtual Tours, and Hangeul. The main page has a catchy title and a sophisticated K-culture background to attract global users.

## Features

*   **K-Food:** Displays a list of Korean food recipes.
*   **Virtual Tours:** Provides virtual tours of famous Korean landmarks.
*   **Hangeul:** A section to learn the Korean alphabet (coming soon).
*   **Impactful Hero Section:** The main page has an impactful hero section with the title "Dive into the K-Verse" and the subtitle "From ancient palaces to the global stage, your journey starts here.", along with a sophisticated K-culture background image.
*   **Impactful Main Content Background:** The main content area now features a subtle K-culture themed background image with a transparent white overlay to ensure text readability.

## Current Task

The current task was to change the background of the main content area to an impactful image.

### Steps Taken

1.  Modified the `style.css` file to add a K-culture themed background image to the `main` element. A `::before` pseudo-element with a semi-transparent white overlay was added to ensure text readability over the background.
2.  Updated the `blueprint.md` file to reflect the changes made to the project.
