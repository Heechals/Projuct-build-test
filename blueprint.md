# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a web application that introduces users to Korean culture. It includes sections for Popular Tests, Virtual Tours, and Hangeul. The main page has a catchy title and a sophisticated K-culture background to attract global users. The main logo in the header now links to the homepage for improved navigation.

## Features

*   **Homepage Link:** The main "Learn Korean Culture" logo in the header now acts as a link to the homepage (`index.html`) across all pages.
*   **Popular Tests:** Displays a list of popular Korean tests, including the Animal Face Test, Korean Meal Recommendation, and Today's Fortune.
*   **Virtual Tours:** Provides virtual tours of famous Korean landmarks.
*   **Hangeul:** A section to learn the Korean alphabet (coming soon).
*   **Impactful Hero Section:** The main page has an impactful hero section with the title "Dive into the K-Verse" and the subtitle "From ancient palaces to the global stage, your journey starts here.", along with a sophisticated K-culture background image.
*   **Impactful Main Content Background:** The entire page now features a subtle K-culture themed background image with a transparent white overlay to ensure text readability, which is visible through the content sections.
*   **Animal Face Test:** A fun test that tells users which animal they look like.
*   **Korean Meal Recommendation:** A dynamic recommendation service that suggests a Korean meal based on the user's local weather, the current season, and the day of the week. It provides the recipe, tips, a representative image, and a reason for the recommendation.
*   **Today's Fortune:** A fun service that provides a personalized fortune for the day based on the user's date of birth. It includes categories for general, money, relationship, and health luck, as well as a lucky color and number.
