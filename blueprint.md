# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a simple, modern web application that will feature a recommendation menu. The goal is to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface using modern web standards.

## Design Principles

*   **Modern Aesthetics:** Clean, minimal, and visually balanced layout.
*   **Intuitive Navigation:** Easy-to-understand menu and interaction.
*   **Responsive Design:** Adapts to various screen sizes.
*   **Accessibility (A11Y):** High contrast, proper sizing, and semantic HTML.

## Implemented Features

### V1 - Initial Structure (Current)

*   **HTML Structure:**
    *   `index.html` with `<header>`, `<nav>`, and `<main>` sections.
    *   A placeholder navigation bar for the recommendation menu.
*   **CSS Styling:**
    *   `style.css` with a modern CSS reset.
    *   Basic layout, typography, and a clean color palette.
    *   Simple hover effects on navigation links.
*   **JavaScript:**
    *   `main.js` is included but currently empty. It will be used for future interactivity.

## Current Plan

1.  **Modify `index.html`:** Add the basic HTML structure including a header, navigation, and main content area.
2.  **Modify `style.css`:** Apply modern styling to the elements in `index.html`.
3.  **Modify `main.js`:** No changes in this step.
