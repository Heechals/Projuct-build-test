            <h2>Korea's Most Famous Summer Destination</h2>
            <p>
                Haeundae Beach, located in the vibrant coastal city of Busan, is one of South Korea's most famous and beloved beaches. With its 1.5-kilometer stretch of white sand and a shallow bay perfect for swimming, it attracts millions of visitors from all over the world every year, especially during the hot summer months.

            <h2>More Than Just a Beach</h2>
            <p>
                The name "Haeundae" was given by the 9th-century Silla scholar Choi Chiwon, who was captivated by the stunning view of the "sea and clouds" from nearby Dongbaekseom Island. Today, the area is a bustling hub of activity year-round. It hosts famous events like the Haeundae Sand Festival and is a key location for the prestigious Busan International Film Festival (BIFF).
